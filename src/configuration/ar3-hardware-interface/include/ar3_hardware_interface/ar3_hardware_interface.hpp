 *
 *
 * This header defines the AR3HardwareInterface class. This is a hardware interface for
 * `ros2_control` that allows the AR3 robot to be controlled by a controller manager.
 *
 * The documentation for `ros2_control` is somewhat unclear on how to implement hardware
 * interfaces. See https://youtu.be/J02jEKawE5U for a good explanation of how the
 * system works.
 *
 * In short, each hardware interface must inherit from one of the following classes:
 *
 * - `hardware_interface::SystemInterface`
 * - `hardware_interface::ActuatorInterface`
 * - `hardware_interface::SensorInterface`
 *
 * A hardware interface implements a state machine that controls its lifecycle:
 *
 *       on_init()                    on_shutdown()
 *          │      ┌────────────────┐      ▲
 *          └─────►│                ├──────┘
 *                 │  Unconfigured  │
 *          ┌──────┤                │◄─────┐
 *          │      └────────────────┘      │
 *  on_configure()                    on_cleanup()
 *          │      ┌────────────────┐      │
 *          └─────►│                ├──────┘
 *                 │    Inactive    │

 *          │      └────────────────┘      │
 *   on_activate()                    on_deactivate()
 *          │      ┌────────────────┐      │
 *          └─────►│                ├──────┘
